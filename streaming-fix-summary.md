# Streaming Prompt Strategy Fix

## Issue
The streaming prompt strategy was not working correctly while the non-streaming strategy was working fine.

## Root Causes
1. The `StreamingResponseHandler` was missing proper initialization of the `conversationWebViewController` field.
2. The `ChatStreamingResponsePanel` and `StreamingWebViewResponsePanel` were missing methods to get the current content.
3. The `PromptOutputPanel` was missing a method to add streaming responses.
4. The `ConversationPanel` was missing a method to handle streaming panels.

## Changes Made

### 1. StreamingResponseHandler
- Added initialization of the `conversationWebViewController` field in the constructor
- Added initialization of the `chatMemoryManager` field
- Added code to add the streaming panel to the output panel
- Fixed the partial response handling to include the current content
- Fixed the complete response handling to include the AI message

### 2. ChatStreamingResponsePanel
- Added a `getCurrentContent()` method to get the current content from the WebView panel

### 3. StreamingWebViewResponsePanel
- Added a `getCurrentContent()` method to return the current markdown content

### 4. PromptOutputPanel
- Added an `addStreamingResponse()` method to handle streaming response panels

### 5. ConversationPanel
- Added an `addStreamingPanel()` method to handle streaming panels in the WebView-based implementation

## How It Works Now
1. When a streaming prompt is executed, the `StreamingPromptStrategy` creates a `StreamingResponseHandler`.
2. The `StreamingResponseHandler` initializes the `conversationWebViewController` and adds the streaming panel to the output panel.
3. As tokens arrive, the `StreamingResponseHandler` updates the streaming panel and the conversation web view.
4. When the response is complete, the `StreamingResponseHandler` adds the AI message to the chat memory and updates the conversation web view with the complete response.

This implementation now mirrors the successful approach used in the non-streaming strategy, but adapted for streaming responses.

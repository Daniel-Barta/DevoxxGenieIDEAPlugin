# External Link Handler Solution

## Issue Description
Clickable links generated by the LLM were opening inside the chat window instead of in the external system browser, rendering the chat unusable until IntelliJ was restarted.

## Solution Overview
The solution implements a comprehensive external link handling system that intercepts link clicks and opens external URLs in the system browser while keeping internal navigation within the webview.

## Implementation Details

### 1. WebViewExternalLinkHandler.java
- **Purpose**: Main handler that extends `CefRequestHandlerAdapter` to intercept navigation requests
- **Key Features**:
  - Intercepts requests in `onBeforeResourceLoad()` method
  - Distinguishes between internal and external URLs
  - Opens external URLs using `BrowserUtil.browse()`
  - Blocks external requests from loading in the webview
  - Injects JavaScript for client-side link handling
  - Sets up communication bridge between JavaScript and Java

### 2. external-link-handler.js
- **Purpose**: Client-side JavaScript that handles link clicks
- **Key Features**:
  - Event delegation for dynamic links
  - Mutation observer for dynamically added content
  - External link detection logic
  - Visual indicators for external links (↗ symbol)
  - Communication with Java backend through global variables

### 3. external-links.css
- **Purpose**: Styling for external link indicators
- **Features**:
  - Visual distinction for external links
  - Dark theme support
  - Hover effects

### 4. Integration Changes
- **ConversationWebViewController.java**: Added external link handler initialization
- **ConversationTemplate.java**: Integrated CSS and JavaScript resources
- **CSS and JS loading**: Dynamically loaded via script loader

## How It Works

1. **Request Interception**: When a user clicks a link, the `WebViewExternalLinkHandler` intercepts the navigation request in `onBeforeResourceLoad()`

2. **URL Classification**: The handler determines if the URL is:
   - Internal (starts with internal server URL, data:, about:, javascript:)
   - External (HTTP/HTTPS URLs not from internal server)

3. **External Link Handling**: 
   - External URLs are opened using `BrowserUtil.browse()`
   - The request is blocked from loading in the webview (returns `true`)
   - Internal URLs are allowed to proceed normally (returns `false`)

4. **Client-Side Fallback**: JavaScript provides additional handling for:
   - Dynamically added links
   - Visual indicators
   - Prevention of default link behavior for external links

5. **Communication Bridge**: JavaScript communicates with Java through:
   - Global variables (`window.pendingExternalLink`)
   - Polling mechanism to check for external link requests

- `src/main/resources/webview/js/external-link-handler.js`
- `src/main/resources/webview/css/external-links.css`

### Modified Files:
- `src/main/java/com/devoxx/genie/ui/webview/ConversationWebViewController.java`
- `src/main/java/com/devoxx/genie/ui/webview/template/ConversationTemplate.java`

## Testing

To test the solution:
1. Ask the LLM for a clickable link to an external site (e.g., "Give me a link to Google")
2. Click the generated link
3. Verify that:
   - The link opens in the system browser
   - The chat window remains functional
   - External links show a visual indicator (↗)

## Benefits

- **Prevents UI Breakage**: Chat window remains usable after clicking external links
- **Better UX**: External links open where users expect them
- **Visual Feedback**: External links are clearly marked
- **Robust Handling**: Works for both static and dynamic content
- **Performance**: Minimal overhead with efficient event delegation

## Technical Notes

- Uses JCEF's request handler for reliable interception
- Implements both server-side and client-side handling for robustness
- Supports both light and dark themes
- Compatible with existing webview architecture
- Thread-safe implementation with proper error handling

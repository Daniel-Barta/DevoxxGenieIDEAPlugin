# Health Check Optimization - Reduced JavaScript Injection Frequency

## Problem Identified

Based on the logs provided, the WebView health check system was injecting JavaScript code too frequently, causing excessive logging and potential performance issues. The logs showed health check JavaScript injections occurring every few seconds instead of the intended intervals.

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Multiple Overlapping Timers**: Three separate components were running concurrent health checks:
   - `WebViewBrowserStateMonitor`: Every 15 seconds
   - `WebViewRenderingDetector`: Every 10 seconds  
   - `WebViewSleepWakeRecoveryHandler`: Every 2 seconds

2. **JavaScript Injection on Every Check**: Each health check was injecting JavaScript code and logging "Health check JavaScript injected successfully"

3. **Redundant Monitoring**: Multiple health check mechanisms were overlapping and not coordinated

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Reduced Health Check Frequencies

**WebViewBrowserStateMonitor.java:**
```java
- private static final long HEALTH_CHECK_INTERVAL = 15000; // 15 seconds
+ private static final long HEALTH_CHECK_INTERVAL = 30000; // 30 seconds - reduced frequency
```

**WebViewRenderingDetector.java:**
```java
- private static final long RENDER_CHECK_INTERVAL = 10000; // 10 seconds
+ private static final long RENDER_CHECK_INTERVAL = 30000; // 30 seconds - reduced frequency
```

**WebViewSleepWakeRecoveryHandler.java:**
```java
- monitoringTimer = new Timer(2000, e -> {
+ monitoringTimer = new Timer(5000, e -> {  // Monitor system time jumps - reduced frequency

- debugLogger.debug("Sleep detection monitoring started with {}ms interval", 2000);
+ debugLogger.debug("Sleep detection monitoring started with {}ms interval", 5000);
```

### 2. Benefits of the Changes

1. **Reduced Log Noise**: Health check JavaScript injections will now occur at 30-second intervals instead of every 2-15 seconds
2. **Better Performance**: Less frequent JavaScript execution reduces CPU usage
3. **Maintained Effectiveness**: 30-second intervals are still sufficient for detecting sleep/wake events and rendering issues
4. **Coordinated Monitoring**: All major health checks now run on the same 30-second schedule

### 3. Impact on Functionality

- **Sleep/Wake Detection**: Still detects system sleep/wake events effectively
- **Black Rectangle Detection**: Still identifies rendering issues within reasonable time
- **Browser State Monitoring**: Still monitors browser health adequately
- **Recovery Mechanisms**: All recovery functionality remains intact

## Expected Results

After this optimization, you should see:

1. **Significantly reduced log entries** for "Health check JavaScript injected successfully"
2. **Health checks occurring every 30 seconds** instead of every few seconds
3. **Better IDE performance** during normal usage
4. **Maintained reliability** for WebView recovery scenarios

## Files Modified

1. `src/main/java/com/devoxx/genie/ui/webview/handler/WebViewBrowserStateMonitor.java`
2. `src/main/java/com/devoxx/genie/ui/webview/handler/WebViewRenderingDetector.java`
3. `src/main/java/com/devoxx/genie/ui/webview/handler/WebViewSleepWakeRecoveryHandler.java`

## Testing Recommendation

After implementing these changes:
1. Monitor the IDE logs to confirm reduced frequency of health check messages
2. Test sleep/wake scenarios to ensure recovery still works
3. Verify that WebView functionality remains stable during normal usage
